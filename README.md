Repo for KU Hackfest 2021

* This project aims to create a disease diagnosis system by analysing medical images.
* This perticular prototype aims to diagnose Tuberculosis using X-ray images. 
* We are using Tensorflow(Convolution neural networks) to predict Tuberculosis. 
* We classify the result into healthy, sick(potential TB), and Active Tuberculosis. 
* We have deployed our model in Django and added some further functionalities. 
* We aim to extend it further by adding other diagnosis techniques and support for another diseases.
* We aim to keep this project opensource to further extend this platform.
